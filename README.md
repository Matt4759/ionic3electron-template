```
npm install -g ionic@latest cordova
```
Clone the repo, change into the  directory, install the npm packages and run the Electron app
```


npm install
npm start
```
You now have Electron and Ionic running as a Desktop app.

# Running Live Reload for Electron Development
When developing a desktop app, you will want to have the app live reload as you save your changes.  
```
npm run dev
```
# Ionic CLI Commands
When developing a web app, progressive app or native mobile app, all of the Ionic CLI commands are available when you are in the src directory, as this is a standard Ionic app.  Change into the src directory and run commands from the Ionic CLI.  
```
cd src
ionic

eg:
ionic serve --lab --port 4000 -r
```







You will need to make sure the NSIS path is added as an environment variable:
```
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS"
```
